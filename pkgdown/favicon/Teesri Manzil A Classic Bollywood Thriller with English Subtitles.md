Teesri Manzil is not only a thrilling story, but also a fascinating behind-the-scenes tale. The film was originally supposed to star Dev Anand, who had a successful collaboration with Nasir Hussain in films like Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai (1961) and Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon (1963). However, due to a creative difference over the script, Dev Anand walked out of the project. Nasir Hussain then approached Shammi Kapoor, who agreed to do the film only after getting Dev Anand's consent. Shammi Kapoor was initially skeptical about the music director R.D. Burman, who was relatively new and inexperienced at that time. He wanted Shankar-Jaikishan, who had composed hit songs for him in films like Junglee (1961) and Kashmir Ki Kali (1964). However, he changed his mind after hearing the first song "Aaja Aaja Main Hoon Pyaar Tera", which became an instant chartbuster. The film also marked the second phase of Premnath's career, who switched from playing hero roles to character roles and villains. He played the role of Kunwar Mahendra Pratap Singh, the owner of The Park hotel and Rocky's uncle.
 
The film also faced some personal tragedies during its making. Shammi Kapoor's wife Geeta Bali died of smallpox during the shooting of the film, leaving him devastated and depressed. He cancelled the shoot for three months and went into isolation. Nasir Hussain waited patiently for him to recover and resume the film. The song "Tumne Mujhe Dekha" was the first song that Shammi Kapoor shot for after his wife's demise. The film also had a complicated love triangle off-screen, as Nasir Hussain was married to assistant choreographer Ayesha Khan, but was also romantically involved with Asha Parekh, whose mother Sudha Parekh was her costume designer and hair stylist. Asha Parekh later revealed in her memoir "The Hit Girl" that she ended her affair with Nasir Hussain as she did not want to be the other woman.
 
Despite all these challenges and controversies, Teesri Manzil emerged as a masterpiece of Indian cinema, showcasing the brilliance of Vijay Anand as a director, Nasir Hussain as a writer-producer, R.D. Burman as a music composer and Shammi Kapoor as a star-actor. The film is also remembered for its stunning cinematography by N Srinivas, who captured the beauty of Mussoorie and Dehradun in his camera. The film also has some interesting trivia, such as the fact that Salman Khan's father Salim Khan played the role of a drummer in black in some of the songs. Teesri Manzil was the last time Shammi Kapoor starred in a Nasir Hussain film. Asha Parekh would go on to do four more films with him, three of which she starred in. Nasir Hussain and Vijay Anand never worked together again after Teesri Manzil.
