## Re-designed emulation engine
 
Phoscyon 2 features a completely re-designed and re-implemented sound engine that captures every nuance and detail of the original 303 circuitry. The signal path has been carefully modeled to achieve an authentic analog sound with all the quirks and character of the hardware. You can tweak every parameter of the synthesis, from the waveform shape and filter cutoff to the accent and slide behavior. You can also access some hidden parameters that were not available on the original 303, such as envelope decay, filter resonance modulation, and waveform symmetry.
 
## Extended set of parameters
 
Besides the standard 303 controls, Phoscyon 2 also offers some additional knobs that were featured on some famous 303 mods and circuit bends. For example, you can adjust the filter envelope modulation amount, which affects how much the filter envelope follows the amplitude envelope. You can also change the filter tracking, which determines how much the filter cutoff changes with the pitch. Moreover, you can access some service trim pots that were originally designed for calibration, such as VCO tuning, VCA bias, and filter tuning.
 
## Vibrato effect
 
Phoscyon 2 also includes a unique vibrato effect that replicates a specific technique used by some 303 artists to create a distinctive 303-style vibrato. The effect is based on two alternating notes that are smoothed by note sliding, resulting in a smooth pitch modulation. The vibrato effect is controlled by two knobs: one for the note spread, which decides the vibrato range, and one for the note duration, which decides the vibrato speed. The vibrato effect can add some extra expression and movement to your acid lines.
 
## FX chain
 
To complement the sound engine, Phoscyon 2 also comes with a state-of-the-art FX chain that contains five insert effects that are specially tuned for acid sounds. The FX chain includes:
 
- A distortion unit with 19 different models based on famous hardware units that are commonly used with 303s.
- A reverb unit with independent settings for early and late reflections.
- A four-band parametric EQ unit.
- A delay unit with tempo sync option and in-loop multi-mode filter.
- A chorus unit with two delay lines.
- A limiter unit with compression characteristics.

The FX chain also allows you to reorder the effects in any way you like, giving you more flexibility and creative possibilities.
 
## Sequencer and arpeggiator
 
Phoscyon 2 also features a super-convenient sequencer and arpeggiator that lets you create your own patterns and riffs with ease. The sequencer has two modes: classic mode and advanced mode. In classic mode, you can program your patterns in a similar way as on the original 303, using step buttons, pitch knobs, accent and slide switches, and pattern length selector. In advanced mode, you can edit your patterns in a more intuitive way using a piano roll editor, where you can drag and drop notes, change their length and velocity, add accents and slides, copy and paste patterns, transpose them by octaves or semitones, randomize them, shuffle them, reverse them, rotate them, or invert them.
 
The arpeggiator is another useful feature that lets you play live arpeggios using your MIDI keyboard or controller. You can choose from different arpeggio modes (up, down, up/down), set the octave range
